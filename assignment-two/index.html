                <h3>General Info</h3>
                 <p>I figured I'd just fill in the text blocks on this page with info about the image I'm using. Ghümi, as seen above, is my silly little guy that I like to use as an avatar around the internet. He's a white-winged vampire bat who's just generally sleepy and kind of dumb.His name is derived from the Bangladeshi word for sleep (Ghüm). </p>

            <!-- Two Collumns-->
            <div>

                <div> 
                    <h3> Vampirism</h3>
                    <p> Ghümi was once a fruit bat who loved a good juice box. Once he was turned into a vampire, he didn't see much issue as he just switched to juice boxes filed with blood instead. 
                    
                    </p>
                </div>
                 <!-- Collumn two-->
                <div> 
                    <h3> Design Choices</h3>
                    <p>Ghümi is mostly comprised with Stars and moons in mind, mostly chosen to represent the sleepy soft hours of the middle of the night. His colouring is mostly purple to make him look like he smells of lavender (the sleepiest smell).</p>
